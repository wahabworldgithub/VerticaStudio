Vertica Studio Objective:
--> To ease the day-to-day operations of Vertica DBAs.

Business Case:
--> DBAâ€™s spend a lot of time and effort in performing their day to day Vertica operations through physical Monitoring, routine checks, generating routine reports etc.,
--> People tend to make human errors for various reasons
--> They spend significant time doing multiple operations as they need to wait and watch till one execution is complete before starting the next. Physical intervention is always required for continuous executions
--> Chances of not following the standards are high as they are currently done manually

Business Outcomes:
--> Easy to use and perform day-to-day operations
--> Saves a lot of time and effort through automated executions
--> No room for human errors as the tool generates recursive SQLs internally
--> Performance improvements through bulk operations
